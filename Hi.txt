Hi Team,
Please find the 5th lesson for React Native: Develop a gallery application that uses geolocation to highlight where the images were taken. It should have SQLite (research based).
Gallery Application with Geolocation and SQLite Requirements:
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a gallery application that allows users to view images and see their locations on a map using geolocation. Additionally, the application should use SQLite for local data storage.
Image Gallery:
Display a grid or list of images stored in the application.
Provide options to view images in full-screen mode or in a carousel/gallery view.
Geolocation Integration:
Utilize the device's geolocation capabilities to tag each image with its location (latitude and longitude).
Display a map in the application that shows the locations of all images on the gallery.
SQLite Database:
Use SQLite to store image metadata, including file paths, timestamps, and geolocation data.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing image data in the SQLite database.
User Interface:
Design a user-friendly interface for browsing images and interacting with the map.
Include features like pinch-to-zoom for images and map, as well as swipe gestures for navigation.
Map Integration:
Integrate a map component (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) to display image locations.
Use markers or other visual indicators on the map to show where each image was taken.
Search and Filter:
Provide search functionality to allow users to search for images based on location, date, or other metadata.
Implement filtering options to view images based on specific criteria (e.g., location, date range).
Security and Permissions:
Ensure that the application requests and handles necessary permissions for accessing geolocation data and storing images.
Implement security measures to protect user data stored in the SQLite database.
Testing:
Test the application thoroughly to ensure that geolocation tagging and SQLite functionality work as expected.
Conduct performance testing to ensure the application performs well, especially when handling a large number of images.
Documentation:
Provide comprehensive documentation for the application, including a user guide and developer documentation for future maintenance and updates.
Presentation:
Prepare a presentation to demonstrate the features and functionality of the gallery application, highlighting the use of geolocation and SQLite.
